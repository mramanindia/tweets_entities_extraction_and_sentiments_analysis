I spend 40% of my time understanding the data and clearing out all the unnecessary elements from the tweets.\n","Some examples of useless elements were Emojis, URL links, and others.\n","\n","After then, I spend 30% of my time reading research papers, Articles on Entity extraction where I get to learn a lot of new concepts.\n","For example, I get too familiar with the term \"Chunking\", \"Tagging\" and other NLP techniques along with I understand the working of Grammarly too.\n","\n","Then for the rest of the time, I worked on the Implementation of my Ideology and a lot of bug fixing.\n","\n","Well, here are the overall Implementation in bullet points.\n","\n","\n","\\\n","**Steps involved in solving the Objectives are:**\n","1.  Raw data Analysis\n","2.  Conversion of Raw data to Dataframe\n","2.  Defining functions for future uses\n","4.  Translating Tweets to the English language\n","3.  Data Pre-processing (Cleaning Tweets)\n","  * Finding text with spaces\n","  * Numbers in the tweets\n","  * URL Link\n","  * Hashtags\n","  * Emojis\n","  * Word less than 2 character\n","  *  And others...\n","\n","4.  Extracting Entities from the tweets with their frequency\n","5.  Data Visualization\n","7.  Solution of Objective 1 (done)\n","8. Authors' sentiment analysis through tweets\n","10. Solution of Objective 2 (done)\n","\n","\\\n","Here are all the steps in detail:\n","### --> Raw Data Analysis\n","Raw data analysis was one of the core parts of the solution-building process as it helped me to understand the problem statement in a better way and I also got the idea for the structure of my Approach.\\\n","Moreover, I also get to know about the major issues in the data that needed to be rectified in the data cleansing process.\n","\n","### --> Conversion of Raw data into dataframe\n","For getting started with the Approach, The main thing was putting data into the mold from where I can easily work with my Ideology.\\\n","Conversion of the Raw data into pandas data frame was the process here.\n","\n","###-->  Defining Functions for future uses\n","For Optimality, I defined functions in the earlier itself along with all the required libraries.\n","\n","### --> Translating tweets into English Language\n","During the Data analysis process itself, I get to know that, some tweets are in the Japanese language.\n","Thus, to get the best out of the data, I converted the Japanese tweets into English using Google translate API.\n","\n","### --> Data Pre-processing\n","Data Pre-Processing was one of the critical tasks in my approach. There was a ton of debris in the data, and cleaning and identifying itself was one of the major tasks.\n","Vision in the Data analysis process, I was aware of, the kind of data there in the tweets. So accordingly, I removed most of them and made a new column with the name clean_tweet to get started with operations.\n","\n","###--> Extracting Entities and counting its frequency\n","Extracting Entities was one of the big Challenges, There were various methods avilable to extract the entities, Like \"tokenization\", and \"Stemming\". But those were limited to the words.\n","In tokenization there needed to fix the word count for extracting entities, but for this problem statement, I wanted dynamic length entities. Entities that give the main idea of the tweets.\n","Thus, after researching for a while, I get to know about the TextBlob library and Noun_phrase extractor.\n","\n","I Implemented that, and it was perfect to move forward with.\n","\n","### --> Data Visualization\n","Visualizing the Entities and their count using graphs for better insights.\n","\n","### --> Objective 1 Soluction\n","For completing objective 1, I created a new data frame with the entities and their frequency count in descending order.\n","Put the file location and with help of the to_csv function, saved it in the directory.\n","\n","###--> Authors sentiments analysis through its tweets\n","This was also one of the challenging Data Engineering and Research based task,\n","First I created a copy of the Data frame of, \"Clean_tweet\", \"Author\", and \"Entites\".\n","Then the task was tagging all the tweets entities of the user in one row.\n","\n","After then, I worked with the NLTK sentiment analysis package where I put the percent of sentiment towards Negtiveness, Postivness, and Neutral of the author.\n","Thus, made a new column and put the leading Sentiment in that.\n","\n","###--> Soluction of Objective 2\n","As for building the solution of objective 1, I made a new data frame and with the help of the to_csv function, saved the data frame in CSV file to the directory.\n","\n","\n","##**Conclucion:**\n","It was amazing working on the assignment. I enjoyed it alot, learned alot, and am quite confident about My approach and the Solution submission.\n","\n","###The most Challenging part and tackling it\n","Sharing the most challenging part for me, It was \"Entity extraction\". \n","I spend tons of my time researching and understanding the logic behind extracting the entity.\n","\n","Understanding what it means, How to extract the core phrases from the tweets on which the meaning depends. \n","But after a lot of reading Articles and documentation over the internet, Researching various libraries, I found the solution.\n","\n","I get to understand that, the most credit-taking words in the tweets are \"Noun\", but there was a problem, with the help of tagging I can get the words with Noun but, again noun is made of multiple words getting them as one was not easy.\n","\n","So I wanted something that extracts the Noun phrases from the clean tweets and insisit of words with nouns only.\n","\n","So I came across the Noun phrase extractor of TextBlob and after reading its functionality, Implemented it in the extraction of Entity.\n","\n","\n","Furthermore, it was not hard concerning this on working over the other part of the solution as the main ingredient was with me.\n","I spend some time, fixing some bugs and was done with the solution.\n","\n","Well, This is all about the approach, I have mentioned the details in the comment with the code for further reference.\\\n","Thanks.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3fMiOb9ejF3A"},"source":["#Beginning"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Installing required pacakage\n","!pip
